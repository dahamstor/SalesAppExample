# Sales Application Example

A simple example of an MVC application, where a user can select a Customer and a Discount Type as well as enter a unit count and Sum of the transaction.

After pressing the Calculate button, a Discounted Sum will be returned on the same view.

The project uses ASP.NET MVC5 with an NpgSql enabled PostgreSQL Database Connection, Ninject for Dependency injection and AutoMapper for mapping properties.
